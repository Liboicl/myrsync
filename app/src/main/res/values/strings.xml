        This simple Application is intended to be a convenient way to create and schedule an rsync command in order to synchronize local folders with a server that is running an rsync daemon.
        It is an ideal solution for people that need to implement a custom cloud file backup in their network so to have total control over where their files are stored. \n\n
        <h3>How to use this app:</h3>\n\n
         1. Create Rsync Configurations.\n
         2. Run them on demand, or create Schedulers attached to them.\n
         3. Check the Overview for details regarding each scheduler/configuration pair.\n
         4. Check the Log for the rsync log entries.\n\n\n

    <string name="rsync_daemon_info">
        Use this form to build an rsync configuration. Before creating any configuration, you must ensure that an rsync daemon is up and running.
        For more details on how to setup and configure the rsync daemon please visit https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsyncd.conf.html \n\n

        This tool will be using the following format of the rsync command:\n\n
        <b>rsync [OPTION…] SRC… rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/DEST</b>\n\n

        With this form you actually build the rsync command by defining the OPTION…, SRC…, USER, HOST, PORT, and DEST Variables \n\n
        OPTION… = This is options string that is formed from the OPTIONS checkboxes. \n
        SRC… = Local Directory Path to be Synced \n
        USER = Authorized Username to connect to the rsync daemon module. \n
        HOST = The IP Address of the server running the rsync Daemon. \n
        PORT = The default port is 873 but may be overriden here if it is different. \n
        DEST = The module name as it is configured in rsync daemon configuration file. \n\n

        <h3>How to Use this Form:</h3>\n\n
         1. Enter the IPv4 address of the server where the rsync daemon is running on. \n\n
         2. Enter the port where the daemon is accepting connections. If the field is left blank then the default port(TCP:873) will be used.\n\n
         3. Type the username that is allowed to connect to the configured module that is described in the confd.conf file of the rsync daemon.\n\n
         4. Type the name of the configured module.\n\n
         5. Click the \'Add Path\' button to select the local directory that will be synced with the daemon.\n\n
         6. Tick the options that will be used with the rsync command. For more info regarding the options and how they are used you can click on the \'?\' button.\n\n
         7. Tap on the \'View Command\' to check the final command that will be run. This step is optional.\n\n
         8. Click on the \'Save\' button to save the configuration. Following this step the configuration will appear on the second tab where you can click on it to edit it or run it.
        Also it will be available to select it in the Scheduler creation form. \n\n\n

        1. Give a Name to your Scheduler\n\n\
        2. Use the drop-down list to select the rsync Configuration that will be executed with this Scheduler. \n\n\
        If the list is empty then you need to create a configuration first before creating the scheduler.\n\n\
        3. Use the clock to select the time that the rsync command will run. Note: Due to android\'s battery optimizations the timer is not exact and may have a few minutes delay.\n\n\
        4. Select the days of the week that the rsync command will run. By default all days are selected.\n\n\
        5. Save the Scheduler. Following this step the Scheduler will be listed on the \'Schedulers\' Tab, where you can click on it to edit it, and in \'Overview\' Tab
        where you can get quick information of the task.\n\n\
